# LUMEN — Earn in the Agent Economy

A working demo for **SPIRAL × Hack-Nation Challenge 02**.

LUMEN is a Lightning-paywalled marketplace that AI agents can buy from
autonomously. A buyer agent (`tripplanner-7`) needs a hotel listing
verified, and then needs an audit receipt for the order it just placed.
The provider (`vision-oracle-3`) sells **two services on one wallet**:

- **`listing-verify`** — OSM-geocoded ground truth, **240 sat** (~$0.16), ~1.1 s
- **`order-receipt`** — HMAC-signed delivery receipt, **120 sat** (~$0.08), ~350 ms

Plus a free **`/api/v1/discovery`** endpoint that publishes the catalogue
in a format crawlable by directories like
[402index.io](https://402index.io). The whole round-trip — `402 → invoice
→ pay → replay → 200` — happens in ~200 ms per call, end-to-end, with no
accounts, no API keys, no checkout.

```
buyer  ──POST /v1/listing-verify──►  provider
       ◄─ 402 + bolt-11 invoice ───
       ──pay (NWC) → preimage ────►  Lightning Network
       ──Authorization: L402 …────►  provider
       ◄─ 200 + verification proof ─
```

Two endpoints, ~250 lines of code, the L402 protocol from the brief.

## Quick start (no wallet, no setup)

Both apps default to **MOCK_MODE=true** — fake invoices, deterministic preimages,
zero sats moved. Use this to verify everything works before touching a wallet.

```bash
# from the repo root
npm run install:all

# single-service flow:
npm run demo

# multi-service flow (verify → receipt, two services on one wallet):
npm run demo:multi
```

You should see the provider start, the buyer run once, the steps print out, and
the verification proof + signed receipt come back. The provider stays up at
<http://localhost:3000> afterwards — visit it in a browser to see the dashboard.

## Going live on Lightning (real sats, mainnet)

Three things you do, two flags I flip.

### Step 1 · Get an Alby Hub account (you, ~3 min)

1. Go to <https://albyhub.com/> → **Sign up** (Alby Cloud is the cheapest path; ~30 sec).
2. Once signed in: top up with **5,000 sats** (≈ $3.30) using the built-in
   "Buy Bitcoin" button. This covers ~20 demo runs.

### Step 2 · Create two NWC connection strings (you, ~2 min)

In Alby Hub: **Apps → Connect a new app**, twice.

| App name         | Permissions               | Paste into                  |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `lumen-provider` | `make_invoice, lookup_invoice` | `provider/.env.local`  → `NWC_URL=` |
| `lumen-buyer`    | `pay_invoice`             | `buyer/.env`     → `NWC_URL=` |

Each gives you a string starting with `nostr+walletconnect://…`. Paste it as the
`NWC_URL` value in the matching env file.

> ⚠️ The provider and buyer can technically share a single Alby wallet, but using
> two separate apps means you can see actual sats moving in the Hub's transaction
> log — way better demo.

### Step 3 · Flip the flags (you, 10 sec)

In **both** `provider/.env.local` and `buyer/.env`:

```diff
- MOCK_MODE=true
+ MOCK_MODE=false
```

### Step 4 · Run the demo (`npm run demo`)

The provider issues a real bolt-11 invoice. The buyer's NWC client pays it.
Lightning settles in 200–800 ms. The provider verifies the preimage against the
on-chain `payment_hash` and serves the result.

If you watch the Alby Hub UI in another tab, you'll see a 240-sat outgoing
payment from `lumen-buyer` and a 240-sat incoming payment to `lumen-provider`.

## How it's wired

### The L402 protocol (in 80 lines)

`provider/src/lib/l402.ts` is the whole paywall:

- **`require402(resource, sats, desc, ttl)`** — mints a macaroon (HMAC-signed
  capability token), creates a Lightning invoice via the wallet adapter,
  returns `HTTP 402` with `WWW-Authenticate: L402 macaroon="…", invoice="…"`.
- **`verifyAuth(authHeader, resource)`** — accepts the replay header
  `Authorization: L402 <macaroon>:<preimage>`, checks the HMAC, checks
  `SHA256(preimage) === payment_hash`, and (in real mode) confirms the invoice
  actually settled with the wallet.

That's it. Real L402 macaroons can carry richer caveats (scopes, expiry, rate
limits) — the spirit is identical here.

### The wallet adapter

`provider/src/lib/wallet.ts` exposes a 2-method interface (`makeInvoice`,
`lookupInvoice`) with two implementations:

- **mock** — generates deterministic preimage + hash pairs in-process.
- **real** — calls `@getalby/sdk` `NWCClient` over Nostr Wallet Connect.

Same interface either way, so the rest of the code never branches on mode.

### The buyer

`buyer/agent.js` is one self-contained Node script. It:

1. POSTs the task without auth → expects 402.
2. Parses the `WWW-Authenticate` header.
3. Runs a spending policy check (`MAX_PRICE_SATS`).
4. Pays — either via `LNClient.pay(invoice)` (real) or `/api/dev/pay` (mock).
5. Replays with the L402 auth header, receives the proof.
6. Prints a colored, time-stamped 6-step receipt.

## Mapping to the brief

| Brief tool        | What it does in LUMEN                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **L402**          | The paywall handshake. Implemented in `provider/src/lib/l402.ts`. |
| **MoneyDevKit**   | See note below.                                              |
| **Alby**          | Both wallets. Single `@getalby/sdk` dependency on each side. |
| **Lexe**          | Drop-in replacement for the Alby provider wallet (set `NWC_URL` to a Lexe NWC string instead). |
| **Spark**         | Reserved for the v2 escrow layer — not in M1–M3 scope.       |

### Why the LUMEN provider doesn't import MDK

The brief markets MoneyDevKit as the canonical way to "add Lightning
payments to any API." In practice the runtime package
`@moneydevkit/nextjs` ships **checkout components** — React + Radix UI +
React Hook Form + QR codes — for selling things to humans through a UI,
not server-side L402 paywalls for selling to agents.

We needed an L402 *server*, so we wrote one — ~80 lines of HMAC-signed
macaroons + preimage verification (`provider/src/lib/l402.ts`). The
upside is a self-contained dependency-light demo with auditable surface
area; the only Lightning library on either end is `@getalby/sdk` (NWC).

If MDK ships an L402-server package later, this is a one-file swap.

## Mapping to the rubric

- **Novel & valuable** — agents can't buy listing-verify-with-photo-proof from any existing API. This sells it for $0.0016 a call.
- **Money moves** — verifiable on Alby Hub's transaction log; preimage included in the response header.
- **Trust & safety** — macaroons are HMAC-signed and resource-scoped; preimage proves payment cryptographically; buyer enforces a per-call cap.
- **Scale** — provider is stateless behind the Lightning rail; routes are async; Next.js handles concurrency.
- **Lightning-native** — couldn't work on cards (240 sat ≪ 30¢ minimum). Couldn't work on stablecoins (no preimage handshake; would need accounts).
- **End-to-end demo** — `npm run demo` shows the full flow in ~200 ms.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`L402_SECRET must be set and ≥32 chars`** — open `provider/.env.local`, the dev value is already long enough.
- **`NWC_URL not set`** — you flipped `MOCK_MODE=false` without pasting NWC strings into both env files.
- **Real-mode payment hangs** — Alby Hub needs an inbound channel to receive. The first incoming payment auto-opens one, which can take ~10s on first run.
- **Port 3000 in use** — set `PORT=3001 npm run provider` and `PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:3001` in `buyer/.env`.

## Want Claude to drive it?

[`PAYMYAGENT.md`](PAYMYAGENT.md) walks you through wiring the LUMEN MCP
server into Claude Desktop. Five minutes; gives Claude six tools, three
spending guardrails (per-call cap, per-session budget, persisted spend
counter), and the ability to hire LUMEN providers per task on real
Lightning. End-to-end verifiable via `npm run test:mcp` (12 checks, no
Claude install required).
